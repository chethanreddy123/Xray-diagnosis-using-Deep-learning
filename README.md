## Smart Fluoroscopic Imaging
Fluoroscopic imaging is globally used for a variety of procedures that include swallow examinations, arthrography, upper and lower bowel examinations, uroscopy (bladder, kidney, ureter). We are looking for smart solutions that enhance fluoroscopic imaging and support the radiologist and radiographer in handling the system and diagnosing the patient.

## Problem Statement:

Intelligent support for X-ray acquisition: collimation, X-ray dose adaption, system positioning etc. according to anatomical structures and clinical question
Adding diagnostic value to the X-ray images during the fluoroscopic procedure through identification of abnormalities, anatomical measurements, anatomical segmentation etc.
Automation of IT: smart handling of DICOM images, new ways of archiving (since not all clinics have a picture archiving communication system (PACS) installed)
User and patient experience: solutions to make the procedure for user and patient as comfortable and as easy as possible, since fluoroscopic procedures are often complex, time-consuming, and painful.
